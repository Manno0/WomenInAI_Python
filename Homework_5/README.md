ðŸ“š Create a Basic Shape Hierarchy
Task: Create a Basic Shape Hierarchy
Objective: Implement a basic inheritance structure with polymorphism in Python.

Create a Base Class:

Define a class Shape with an initializer to set a name attribute.
Add a method area() that returns None (this will be overridden in subclasses).
Create Subclasses:

Define a subclass Rectangle that inherits from Shape.
Add attributes width and height in the initializer.
Override the area() method to return the area of the rectangle.
Define a subclass Circle that inherits from Shape.
Add an attribute radius in the initializer.
Override the area() method to return the area of the circle (use math.pi for the value of Ï€).
Demonstrate Polymorphism:

Create a function print_area(shape) that takes a Shape object and prints its name and area.
Instantiate a Rectangle and a Circle and call print_area() for each.
